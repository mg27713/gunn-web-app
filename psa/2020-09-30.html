<p>There are also some improvements to the club and staff lists:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added a link button for linking to clubs and staff members</li>
  <li>
    Teacher schedules in the staff list now show room numbers (very useful)
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed non-teachers sharing a last name with a teacher stealing their
    schedules
  </li>

    are now available for clubs like the Competitive Programming Club
  </li>
</ul>

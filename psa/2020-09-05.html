<p>Updates:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dialogs now have a dim background that you can click on to close.</li>
  <li>
    UGWA no longer confidently guesses which period meets during Gunn Together
    because I'm not sure if even the school knows.
  </li>
  <li>
    Links can now properly automatically open some amount of time before class
    starts, as opposed to only immediately when it starts.
  </li>
</ul>

  The club list now also features club videos that are publicly available on

  Videos that are only accessible within PAUSD are still not shown because, as
  with anything, added security complicates things.

<p>Some statistics for club videos:</p>
<ul>
  <li>42 videos are on YouTube.</li>
  <li>57 videos are on Google Drive, 19 of which are private.</li>

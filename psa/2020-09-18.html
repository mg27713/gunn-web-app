<ul>
  <li>UGWA's PSAs are now a bit more obnoxious again.</li>
  <li>Updated the club list!</li>
  <li>
    UGWA is now less time zone dependent, so if you're attending Gunn from
    abroad, UGWA won't think that the entire Gunn campus has moved with you.
  </li>
  <li>
    Gunn Together week 5 is now noted as period 4, and its badge text colour is
    now also white in light theme.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>By the way, here's a fun problem if you're bored. What comes next?</p>

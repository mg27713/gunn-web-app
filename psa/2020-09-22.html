<p>Some updates for the club fair:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The club list now shows a random selection of club videos (but only those
    that are on YouTube).
  </li>
  <li>
    Clubs added to your list now have a Join link in the schedule so you can
    quickly join the provided Zoom meeting link.
  </li>
  <li>Fixed the "Add to my clubs" button not showing.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The club list will be updated regularly maybe until they rectify the spelling
  of the "Competative Programming Club."
